//! All the required to run a transaction
//!
//! Originally, this module was used for extracting the `unsafe` implementation details of `transaction`.
//! Since then, all the code here has been made safe.
//! However, it is possible that in the future, we'll need more unsafe code, in which case it would likely
//! have to come here.
//!
//! The API exposed from here is entirely safe, and this module's code should be properly audited.
